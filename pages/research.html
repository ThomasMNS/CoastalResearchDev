    <p>We are undertaking impactful research across a range of topics, investigating the interactions between land, water and artifical structures to develop knowledge in increasingly important areas such as coastal erosion and renewable energy development. Our work is regularly practial and applied in nature, and carried out in collaboration with collegues from across academia, government and the commerical sector. Some notable projects are detailed below.  </p>
<h3>Coastal Processes</h3>
<h4>Investigating Intertidal Morphology on the Fylde Coast</h4>
<p><strong>People:</strong> Dr Suzana Ilic, Dr Andrew Miles</p>
<p>Coastal morphology evolves over a range of spatial and temporal scales, and detailed observations are required to fully understand the processes that are occuring. This project involved an in-depth study of the morphological evolution of the Fylde coast in the north-west of England, and utilised a wide range of datasets and methodologies from traditional beach profile surveys, to advanced LiDAR and video imaging and numerical modelling, to novel sediment tracer techniques. </p>
<p>The project improved understanding of the morphological changes occuring over spatial scales from metres to kilometres, and temporal scales from hours to days, and particularly focused to the intertidal bar system that dominates the coastline and the sediment transport system that it facilitates. This has produced valuable information that will help to inform future coastal management strategies.  </p>

<h3>Renewable Energy and the Environment</h3>
<h4>Offshore Wind Power</h4>
<p><strong>People:</strong> Dr Suzana Ilic, Dr David McGovern, Dr Jamie Luxmoore</p>
<p>Offshore wind is an important and rapidly expanding form of renewable energy, and has seen significant investment in recent years. We have carried out large scale flume experiments at the Total Environment Simulator in Hull, U.K, to investigate the development of scour around the base of offshore wind turbines in tidal currents with variable flow velocity and depth. This is a significant issue associated with the deployment of offshore wind, as it can reduce turbine stability and longevity, and expose buried cables. </p>
<p>Despite this, there have been relatively few laboratory experiments looking at the problem of scour around cylindrical structures in tidally induced flow. This project therefore helped to fill an important knowledge gap, providing data on the rate of scour and bed forms produced, which will prove valuable in planning future wind energy developments and validing existing numerical models.  </p>

<h3>Research in Croatia</h3>
<h4>Morphological Variability of Gravel Beaches</h4>
<p><strong>People:</strong> Dr Suzana Ilic, Dr Kristina Pikelj</p>
<p>We have strong, long-standing links with Croatia. As well as running an undergraduate field course to the Istrian Peninsula each year looking the challenges of water management, we have also carried out research monitoring the morphological variability of pocket gravel beaches at Dugi Rat and Brseč. These gravel beaches are important landforms, effectively dissipating wave energy and proving popular toursist attractions, but are rarely studied compared with their sandy counterparts. </p>
<p>Our work has involved using modern Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry techniques to examine beaches in 3D, providing valuable data on the spatial and temporal patterns of morphological change, sediment transport, and the effects of storm induced waves.  </p>

<h3>Remote Sensing and Modelling</h3>
<h4>Analysis of Airborne LiDAR</h4>
<p><strong>People:</strong> Dr Suzana Ilic, Dr Andrew Miles, Thomas Burke</p>
<p>Lidar (LIght Detection And Ranging) is an increasingly popular source of data in coastal studies. With the ability to observe change occuring along an entire stretch of coastline with good accuracy, it would not be hyperbolic to say that the technique has revolutionised the field of coastal monitoring over the course of the past decade. </p>
<p>We have significant experience with the geospatial processing and analysis of LiDAR elevation data and it's use in coastal studies, especially along England's Fylde coast. This has involved investigating bar migration at Cleveleys, and the effects of Groynes on beach morphology and sediment transport at Fleetwood. In addition to this, many of our undergraduate and graduate dissertation projects now involve the analysis of Lidar datasets. Some of the tools we have developed for analysing Lidar data can be found <a href="file:///D:/Documents/University/Coastal%20Research%20Website/output/pages/tools.html">here</a>.  </p>

<h4>Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry</h4>
<p><strong>People:</strong> Dr Michael James, Dr Suzana Ilic, Dr Kristina Pikelj, Thomas Burke</p>
<p>We were amongst the earliest users of Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry in a geomorphological setting, a modern technique that allows for the rapid creation of 3D point clouds and digital elevation models from unordered, convergent sets of images, often acquired using a consumer grade digital camera. </p>
<p>In the U.K, we have used SfM techniques to monitor the erosion of a 3 metre high, 50 metre long section of soft coastal cliff at Sunderland Point in the north-west of England. Traditionally this would be done using erosion pins, however the sparse spatial coverage of the data these provide limits the extent to which the spatial variability in erosion rates can be examined. Using SfM however, we were able to monitor change across the whole cliff face, providing valuable information on the spatial and temporal variability of eroson, and how this correlates with weather and wave data. On a far smaller scale, we have have used SfM to study patterns of deposition and erosion around patches of intertidal saltmarsh vegetation at Morecambe, U.K. With changes of just a few centimetres expected, variations in bed form can be difficult to measure, and most strategies require the use of elaborate field equipment, which can be especially cumbersome to deploy in an intertidal coastmarsh environment. Using images acquired from a consumer grade digital camera, we surveyed two patches of vegetation daily over the course of a month, identifying areas of erosion and deposition, and even observing the patterns of bed ripple migration. </p>
<p>In Croatia, we have used SfM photogrametry to investigate changes in pocket gravel beaches. These beaches are important for coastal protection and promoting tourism, and can be affected by both natural and man-made changes in the catchment. As they are often located in coastal coves, surrounded by steep headlands and slopes with limited accesibility, SfM photogrametry, with it's minimal amount of required equipment, is an obvious tool of choice. We have carried out studies in several locations including Brseč and Uboka cove in Kvarner Bay, and Dugi Rat beach and Glavica at Dugi Rat Village, examinig changes in beach volume, morphology and orientation, and how these correspond with changes in weather and the resulting wave regime. We have also used SfM in studies to assess the stability of coastal cliffs at Stara Baška, Krk, using it to obtain the geometric parameters required by a cantilever-beam model. </p>
<p>Through these studies, we have gathered information on both the coastal processes occuring in different areas, and also the Structure-from-Motion technique itself, assessing different software packages and image acquisition techniques. Details of tools we have developed for the analysis of SfM derived point clouds can be found on the <a href="file:///D:/Documents/University/Coastal%20Research%20Website/output/pages/tools.html">links page</a>.</p>
